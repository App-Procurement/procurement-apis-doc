# Welcome!

## Welcome to Procurement Aplication API

The procurement API is organized around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational\_State\_Transfer). Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts [form-encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST\_\(HTTP\)#Use\_for\_submitting\_web\_forms) request bodies, returns [JSON-encoded](http://www.json.org/) responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

## Want to jump right in?

Feeling like an eager beaver? Jump in to the quick start docs and get making your first request:

{% content-ref url="quick-start.md" %}
[quick-start.md](quick-start.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Want to deep dive?

Dive a little deeper and start exploring our API reference to get an idea of everything that's possible with the API:

{% content-ref url="reference/api-reference/" %}
[api-reference](reference/api-reference/)
{% endcontent-ref %}
